Option 1: Minimal (no pinned versions)

If you just want the basic dependencies without version pinning:

Flask
requests
python-dotenv
newspaper3k

Option 2: Recommended (with pinned versions)

For a reproducible environment, use pinned versions that are stable and widely compatible:

Flask==2.3.3
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
newspaper3k==0.2.8

Option 3: Auto-generate from your environment

Run this command in your virtual environment:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


This will capture exact versions currently installed in your environment — ideal if you’ve tested and confirmed everything works.
